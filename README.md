# OmiseGO Backend Development challenge

Greetings! and thank you for checking out my version of the OmiseGO backend challenge. I hope you enjoy reviewing this project as much as I have creating it. 

When you go to the live site, you will be greeted with part two of the challenge, the github search. I felt adding an actual search box was in order, it is actually pretty useful for searching github!
